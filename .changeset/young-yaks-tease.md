'@httpx/exception': minor
---

Reduce drastically bundle size (use es2022)

Importing a single exception starts at 377 bytes, subsequent ones will add less than 50 bytes in average.

> PS: if you use exceptions outside of nodejs and need to support legacy browsers
> a lot of frameworks allows to transpile modules (ie nextjs).
