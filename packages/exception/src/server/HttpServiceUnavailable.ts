/**
 * 503 Service Unavailable
 *
 * The server is not ready to handle the request. Common causes are a server that is down for maintenance
 * or that is overloaded. Note that together with this response, a user-friendly page explaining the problem
 * should be sent.
 *
 * This response should be used for temporary conditions and the Retry-After HTTP header should, if possible,
 * contain the estimated time before the recovery of the service. The webmaster must also take care about the
 * caching-related headers that are sent along with this response, as these temporary condition responses
 * should usually not be cached.
